*Worker pool*
All worker (specialized or not) belong to the worker pool. We have the following types:
  * Unskilled workers (can work in factories, every other type can always be reduced to unskilled workers)
  * Skilled workers (can work in factories, work more efficiently)
  * Scientists (work in university, explore the country or techs)
  * Engineers (can improve the country, rails, mines, ...)
  * Trained military (go to military soldier pool, aka reserve)

*Natural resources*
  * Wood, Coal, copper, ore, oil - Heavy industries (tools, weapons, railways)
  * Fish, Grain, Apples - Food
  * Sheep, Cotton - Clothing
  * Silver, Gold - Direct Money

*Production*
  * 2 wood = 1 timber or 1 paper in the paper mill/factory
  * 2 timber = 1 furniture in the furniture factory

  * 1 ore + 1 coal = 1 steel in the steel mill/factory
  * 2 steel = 1 weapon or 1 tool in the tool factory

  * 2 wool or 2 cotton = 1 cloth in the spinning factory
  * 2 cloth = 1 garment in the clothing factory

  * 2 oil = 1 fuel in the rafinery
  * 2 fuel = 1 power in the power plant

  * 2 grains + 1 meat or fish + 1 apple = 1 can of food in the cannery
