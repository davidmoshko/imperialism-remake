#summary Generalizes the new design to see if there is a broader application area.
#labels Phase-Design

*Aim*: carefully evaluate generalizations and abtractions of the concept to exploit synergy effects and create a bunch of highly interesting strategy games with many different settings on the same plattform easily. Therefore common parts must be identified.

=List of possible generalizations, abstractions=

*Just the battle and provinces part*

Panzer General on a map with provinces

*Battle and provinces and simplified economics, research, diplomacy*

Special historical settings like 2nd worldwar: HoI, Pacific Admiral or ancient world: Carthage, Rom, Greece, Persia

Fantasy settings: Lord of middleearth, Fantasy General

No inherent campaign mode though.

*Extending in direction of Civilization like style*

Extending provinces a lot, expanding research a lot. Exploring the map (now fully explored). (World map would be cool).

*Massive Multiplayer*

For example in a Sci-Fi setting and instead of provinces we have space battles.
