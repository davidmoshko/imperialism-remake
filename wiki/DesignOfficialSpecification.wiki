== 5. Industry and Infrastructure ==

=== Worker pool ===

The worker pool (_W: integer_) contains workers (employed and unemployed, skilled and unskilled), all scientists and all engineers. Without cost all specialists can always be reduced to unskilled workers.

We have the following types:
  * Unskilled workers (can work in factories, need food, basic type)
  * Skilled workers (can work in factories, need food and money, more efficient)
  * Scientists (can work in college or university, explore new technology)
  * Engineers (can improve the country, your own, also minor nations)

=== Natural resources ===

Resources
  * Wood, Coal, Ore, Oil - heavy
  * Fish, Grain, Fruits, Meat - food
  * Sheep/Cotton - cloth
  * Silver - money

Rules
  * Except fish, everything has to be developed by an engineer
  * Everything can be developed up to third level
  * Everything must be connected by rail (or fish by lighthouse) in at least a neighoring map tile

=== Production ===

*Resources to raw material (level x to x units per turn)*
  * wood to wood
  * coal to coal
  * ore to ore
  * oil to oil
  * grain to grain (side dish)
  * fish, fruits, meat to meat (main dish)
  * sheep, cotton to wool
  * silver to money

*Raw material to advanced material*
  * _Paper mill_: 2 wood to 1 timber, 2 wood to 1 paper
  * _Steel mill_: 1 ore + 1 coal to 1 steel
  * _Tool factory_: 2 steel to 1 tool, 2 steel to 1 weapon
  * _Spinning factory_: 2 wool to 1 cloth
  * _Clothing factory_: 2 cloth to 1 garment
  * _Cannery_: 1 grain + 1 meat to 1 can of food
  * _Rafinery_: 2 oil to 1 fuel
  * _Power plant_: 2 fuel to 1 power
  * _Train station_: 1 timber + 1 steel to 1 transport

These products can also be used to buy ships and to trade or to extend the factories and are also consumed by the workers.

=== Trade ===

Tradable are are resources and products.

= 6. Military =

----

= 7. Artificial Intelligence

Requirements:
  * Should come in different difficulty levels (3 or 5)
  * Should not take too long to think
  * Should be predictable
  * Should memorize past actions (make it human, tit for tat)
  * Should display reasons for it's actions
  * Should have optional a personal flavor for each grand nation, definable by some sort of sliders (peacefulness, greedyness, ...)

----

= 7. User interface =

== Start screen ==

Purpose:
  * New random scenario (picture of a globe)
  * New historical scenario (european map)
  * Load game (image of documents)
  * MP joing a game (map with differently colored figure)
  * Languages (speech ballong with flags and names)
  * Exit (two wings of a door)
  * Help/Credits (click on logo)

Comments:
  * Upon loading the main elements should be made visible only after a certain time, eg. fade in after 2 seconds.
  * Upon change of language, the programm needs to restart, need notification about it.
  * We start fullscreen and expect at least 1024 x 768.

== Main map screen ==

== Minor ==
  * There will be a real time clock in one corner of the screen, can be turned off in the options
