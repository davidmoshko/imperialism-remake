* 2. Getting Started


  A Java Runtime Environment version 7 (or later) is required (Oracle JRE, OpenJDK)!


  All OS: Start with    java -jar imperialism-remake.jar

   Or with click/double click on the jar file if your system is configured
   to execute jar files directly. (Linux: Set the executable bit on the jar first.)


  Windows: Start with   windows-launcher.exe

   If the java launcher cannot find the main class, Java is most probably outdated.
   Update Java to version 7. http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp
